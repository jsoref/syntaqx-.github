## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the
   layer when performing a build.
2. Update the `README.md` or `docs` with details of change to the project, this
   includes new flags, environment variables, exposed ports, useful file
   locations and container parameters.
3. Specify how your change should affect our versioning scheme when merged. For
   more information on how we implement versioning, check out the [semver][]
   documentation. PRs will be grouped into logical version groups so that we
   aren't incrementing the version on every merge.

   developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request a
   reviewer to merge it for you.
