# API Documentation

This is the documentation for the REST API. The API allows you to access your
personal information as well as resources associated with your account, and
those you've been given access to.

## Authentication

Every user has an API Token that can be retrieved from your [settings page](.).
The API uses standard Token-based authentication.

To use the authentication simply send the `Authentication` header like so:

```curl
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN
```

## Endpoints

The endpoints are grouped by resource:

- Resource 1
- Resource 2
- Resource 3
- Resource 4
